# Project2_Uber_Analysis
Project Description: Analyzing the Uber Data to predict the car demand in certain location and optimizing the loss to increase the profit.

Introduction: This data set is a masked data set which is similar to what data analysts at Uber handle. Solving this assignment will give an idea about how problems are systematically solved using EDA and data visualisation.
Business Understanding : You may have some experience of travelling to and from the airport. Have you ever used Uber or any other cab service for this travel? Did you at any time face the problem of cancellation by the driver or non-availability of cars? Well, if these are the problems faced by customers, these very issues also impact the business
of Uber. If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its revenue.

As an analyst, you decide to address the problem Uber is facing - driver cancellation and non-availability of cars leading to loss of potential revenue.

Problem Objectives: The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation. As a result of analysis, need to present the the root cause(s) and possible hypotheses of the problem(s) and recommend ways to improve them.

Dataset Description:
1. Request id: A unique identifier of the request
2. Time of request: The date and time at which the customer made the trip request
3. Drop-off time: The drop-off date and time, in case the trip was completed
4. Pick-up point: The point from which the request was made
5. Driver id: The unique identification number of the driver
6. Status of the request: The final status of the trip, that can be either completed, cancelled by the driver or no cars available
Note: For this assignment, only the trips to and from the airport are being considered.

Libraries Involved:

1. Pandas
2. Seaborn
3. Matplotlib

Steps Involved:
1. Load the Uber Data
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Analysis
4. Analysing Demand

Conclusion:
Providing incentive to driver can help in easy movement of the cab within and outside the city to meet-up the demand of large distance travel.
